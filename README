PyIMAQ
======

Python library to interface with the National Instruments (NI) Vision
Acquisition Software (VAS). Support for NI-IMAQ and NI-IMAQ I/O is planned.
The NI-IMAQdx interface is non-free, thus I don't have access to it
at the moment.

Unfortunately, NI-IMAQ is available only on Microsoft Windows computers,
and apparently no Linux support is planned at this time.

On Windows, PyIMAQ talks to the proprietary DLLs provided by NI.

Design
======

PyIMAQ follows a similar architecture to PyVISA [1] (different author).
A core functionality is provided, that can be thought of a "c header ->
python" translation. If you want to write your own routines over these
function references then you only need that single file.

A more "Pythonized" intermediate layer is also available ready to use.
